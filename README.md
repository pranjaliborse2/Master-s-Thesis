+ This repository contains the files related to the research work I did as a part of my thesis while studying Master of Science in Civil Engineering at 
University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.
+ This work is a research based on investigating the impacts of Climate variability on the public health where specific focus is on 
West Nile Virus carrying mosquitoes.
+ The main objectives of this research was to identify the crucial time period of the virus spread in context of the weather and how 
seasonality impacts the population of virus carrying mosquitoes.
+ I extensively studied the parameters like temperature and precipitation, extreme weather, mesoscale meteorological events to identify the ties between them and the virus mosquito.
+ All the data analysis was performed using Python which involved exploratory data analysis, statistical data analysis and use of machine learning techniques
+ The end result of the research is a supervised machine learning model- Decision tree classifier which helps determine the thresholds of rainfall and temperatures beyond which it
  is detrimental to public health as virus surge is noticed beyond these thresholds
+ It could be a crucial tool to determine the yearly statistics of virus spread beforehand and make informed decisions to curb the plausible impacts of the virus.
